The main goal in this assignment is to classify whether comments are toxic or not.
* I implemented Bag of Words.
* I implemented TF-IDF.
* I used word2vec from the gensim library.
* I used LogisticRegression from sklearn.
* I used LogisticRegression implemented on a PyTorch.
* Also I used Naive Bayes classifier.

As a result, I managed to achieve ROC AUC = 0.93 on validation.
